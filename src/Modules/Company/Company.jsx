                In an industry saturated with small-scale management providers, Atlas management has proven to be a strong leader by setting the bar in online financial reporting and maintenance comprehension.  All investors have two aspects of utmost importance: consistent returns and minimizing costs. Accelerating in these domains has given Atlas the edge to be the one of the largest third-party providers in quality student accommodations in Waterloo.
              </p><br /><br /><br />
              <p>By combining our theory of strong money management and internal maintenance, Atlas engages the student demographic to live in a social environment that sparks the inner-community of each building. Providing safe places to meet with other students and participate in events such as the Atlas Annual Fall BBQ, food drives, and clothing donation drives. Every term gives us sought-after results: high retention rates and reduced damages. We have found that social involvement reaps many rewards, including larger returns, higher retention and a positive reputation in the community.</p>
